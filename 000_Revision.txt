1-Aug-2014 Rev 1C release
---------------------------
New Feature
-----------
(1) Logger window: Console Append into single Filename as well as discerte filename (retained feature)
    If enable, it operates operate alongside with Console discrete append filename (with timestamp). 
	The purpose of this is it eliminate stitching between discrete filename prior to transfer into excel. This can save lot of effort. 
	To enable this, goto logger window within Tools top menu and check <Enable Append One Filename>
	NB: This option by default disabled

(2) Up and Down cursor key to recall previous command is now supported. This speed up typing repeat commands. this work on main window.

(3) The Cut/Copy/Paste on main window is reprogrammed and functional (more reliable). Untested in Logger window. Just select area and copy into clipboard for other app.

(4) If there is more than two FTDI device, user will have choice to select by checking message box and select YES or NO (which is quick way to write code). 
    Up to 5 device is supported.
 
 NB: It is now possible to open discrete ADT logger application for multi board as part of  oven testing  

Bug Fixed
---------
None.

------------
Further work
------------
(1) Can protocol to be addeed which based on RX/TX in UART fashion via fixed protocol in slave device. Include SNAD (device address support for multiple board testing). MC team.
(2) Directional Display Panel which display accel and magnetometer, logging and inclination/azimuth for product debugging and calibration. This is new window RP
(3) Setup SNAD concept for multi-board as part of oven screening procedure (in UART). This can take few day to implement. RP.
